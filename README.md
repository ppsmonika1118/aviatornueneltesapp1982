## Aviator Game Guide

The Aviator game is simple yet engaging. The gameplay revolves around a
plane that takes off, and players must cash out their winnings before
the plane flies away. Here\'s how to get started:

1.  **Place a Bet**: Choose the amount you want to wager.
2.  **Watch the Plane**: The plane will start flying, and the multiplier
    will increase as the plane stays in the air.
3.  **Cash Out**: The goal is to cash out your bet before the plane
    flies away. The longer the plane stays in the air, the higher the
    multiplier---but beware, if the plane flies away before you cash
    out, you lose your bet.

The key strategy is to balance risk and reward---decide whether you want
to cash out early for a lower reward or wait longer for a bigger payout.
